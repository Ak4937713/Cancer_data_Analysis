Project Title: Cancer Diagnosis Dashboard and EDA(Benign vs Malignant)

Domain: Healthcare / Medical Research / Biotechnology

Objective:
To visually analyze key tumor characteristics and identify distinguishing patterns between benign and malignant tumors using Power BI.

Tools & Technologies:
- Microsoft Power BI
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- Python 

Dataset Source:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset

Data Type: Structured tabular data (numeric)

Dataset Size:
- Rows: 569
- Columns: 32

Target Variable: Diagnosis (B = Benign, M = Malignant)

Key Features Used:
- Radius_mean
- Texture_mean
- Area_mean
- Smoothness_mean
- Concavity_mean
- Symmetry_mean
(and other related feature metrics)

Dashboard Features:
- Summary Cards (Total Records, Benign cases, Malignant cases)
- Bar Charts comparing feature averages across diagnosis types
- Clean, research-oriented layout
- Diagnosis-based feature information of important parameter

Limitations:
- No time, age, or demographic variables present.
- Static analysis without predictive modeling (ML not included)
