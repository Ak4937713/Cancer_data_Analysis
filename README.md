# Cancer_data_Analysis
This repository contains information related to Cancer data Analysis. 
## 📌 Objective

To understand key characteristics of tumor samples and identify which features are most associated with **malignant diagnoses**. This includes visual analysis, statistical summary, and insight generation.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- 📁 Source: `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()` or [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))
- 🔢 Features: 30 numeric predictors (e.g., mean radius, texture, concavity)
- 🎯 Target: `diagnosis` (Malignant = 0, Benign = 1)

# Question
- What patterns in the data are associated with malignant tumors?
- Which features offer the best class separation?
